# open_qwen36 — Qwen3.6-MoE, Qwen3 dense, Llama 3 and Gemma 3 on open XDNA2 kernels

The open replacement for the closed `qwen3_6_moe_npu` engine. It sits behind
the app's `causal_lm` seam ([engine.hpp](engine.hpp)), so the tokenizer, chat
template, sampler, prompt cache and server — all already open — drive it the
same way they drive the closed DLL. Below the seam it is:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| [q4nx_file.cpp](q4nx_file.cpp) | reads FLM's `.q4nx` container (mmap; the 1.0.2 q4_1 format, refuses others) — replaces `q4_npu_eXpress.dll` on this path |
| [manifest.cpp](manifest.cpp) | reads the kernel set's `manifest.json`: layouts, contexts, kernels, per-layer programs, the packing plan, and the model check |
| [pools.cpp](pools.cpp) | interprets the manifest's packing plan: each layer's weights into the byte order the kernels stream, straight into resident device buffers (the same plan `open_kernels/recipes/pack.py` runs in NumPy) |
| [core.cpp](core.cpp) | device, contexts, kernels, 21 GB of resident pools, per-layer state; runs the manifest's program per layer, one `step()` per token |
| [engine.cpp](engine.cpp) | the `causal_lm` adapter: forward / prefill / checkpoint / restore / KV accessors |
| [cli.cpp](cli.cpp), [chat.py](chat.py) | drive the engine without the app (ids in, tokens out; `chat.py` tokenizes) |
| [manifest_test.cpp](manifest_test.cpp) | the OPEN-MANIFEST unit test (no XRT): parses the checked-in fixture, checks the model refusals |
| `../xclbins/<model>/open_kernels/` | `manifest.json` + the six kernels (`lx0 lx1 ax0 ax1 ln lm_head_q8`), **built, not checked in** — see below |

The kernels are `open_kernels/designs/layer_x` (+ `ln`, `lm_head_q8`): one xclbin
context per layer type, two dispatches per layer (everything up to the router;
then the MoE block once the host has re-pointed the expert fills at the
router's top-8), plus the final norm and the q8 lm_head. Per-token instruction
patching (`open_kernels/harness/stream_patch.hpp`) is what lets one compiled
program serve every layer and every position.

**No model constant lives in the C++.** The engine is an interpreter of
`manifest.json`, which `open_kernels/recipes/` writes from the model's
`ModelSpec` (hidden size, heads, experts, ... from `config.json`): the
consts / act / state / pool offsets, the KV row, which xclbin serves which
layer type, the verb sequence per layer (`run lx0` → `moeroute2 lx1` →
`run lx1`; `run ax0` → `moeroute2 ax1` → `run ax1`; then `ln`, `lm`), and the
tensor → pool-offset → chunk-order plan the packer follows. The same recipe
parametrizes the IRON designs, so the numbers in the instruction streams and
the numbers the driver uses have one source. A model whose `config.json`
disagrees with the manifest is refused at startup with the key named
(`specs/open-engine/spec.md`, OPEN-MANIFEST).

## Building the kernels

The compiled kernels are not in the repository (`.gitignore`), the same rule
as the BERT design sets: the source is `open_kernels/designs/` plus the recipe
in `open_kernels/recipes/`, and one command produces the six `final.xclbin` +
`insts.bin` pairs the engine loads and the `manifest.json` it reads, in the
directory it loads them from:

```
source ~/ironenv142/bin/activate            # mlir-aie 1.4.2 + Peano (ironvenv-requirements.txt)
export PATH=~/xrt-tools/bin:$PATH           # xclbinutil, aiebu-asm (from an XRT build)
python open_kernels/export_qwen36_kernels.py [--model-dir ~/.flm/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NPU2]
#   -> src/xclbins/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NPU2/open_kernels/{lx0,lx1,ax0,ax1,ln,lm_head_q8}/
#      + manifest.json + spec.json + toolchain.json
```

`--model-dir` derives the spec from that model's `config.json` (default: the
checked-in `recipes/specs/qwen36-35b-a3b.json`, the same model). The
manifest's `build_key` hashes the recipe, every kernel source the designs
include, the spec and the quant format; an export whose manifest already
carries the key is skipped (`--force` rebuilds). A shipped kernel directory
without a manifest needs one before the engine will take it:
`cd open_kernels && python -m recipes.manifest --model-dir <model> --out <kernel dir>/manifest.json`.

| set | design | knobs | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lx0` | `layer_x/lx.py` | `LX_PART=0` | linear-attention layer, dispatch 0 (norm → qkv/z → glue → DeltaNet → post → out → norm → router) |
| `lx1` | `layer_x/lx.py` | `LX_PART=1` | its MoE block (same xclbin as `lx0`, second instruction stream) |
| `ax0` | `layer_x/ax.py` | `AX_PART=0` | full-attention layer, dispatch 0 |
| `ax1` | `layer_x/ax.py` | `AX_PART=1` | its MoE block |
| `ln` | `ln/ln.py` | — | final RMSNorm |
| `lm_head_q8` | `lm_head_q8/lm_head_q8.py` | `LMHEAD_N=248320 LMHEAD_CORES=8` | q8 lm_head, full vocab |

About 6 minutes for all six on a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 (WSL; ~90 s per layer_x set). `--only lx0,lx1`
rebuilds a subset, `--out DIR` redirects (a model directory's `open_kernels/`
and `FLM_OPEN_KERNELS_DIR` are the engine's other two lookup locations; each
must hold a `manifest.json` naming files that exist).
`toolchain.json` records the mlir-aie and Peano versions, this tree's commit,
and every file's sha256. The distributed package ships the built kernels; a
source checkout builds them. In WSL the kernels are built and on Windows they
run: the export writes into the shared checkout, so nothing needs copying.

**Is the source really the source?** `--check DIR` compares a fresh build with
a previous one. Checked here (2026-09-05) against the binaries this PR
originally shipped, built 2026-09-04 on the same toolchain:

| | result |
|---|---|
| 6 × `insts.bin` (the instruction streams) | **byte-identical** |
| 6 × `final.xclbin` | identical apart from **78–82 bytes each**: the axlf header's unique id, timestamp and UUID, the PDI's UUID in `AIE_PARTITION`, the boot-image header's unique id and the checksum that covers it, and xclbinutil's `XCLBIN_MIRROR_DATA` JSON tail that repeats the header |

Every CDO and every AIE core ELF matched; `--check` masks exactly those stamp
fields (parsing the axlf and partition structs, not by offset guesswork) and
fails on any other byte. A rebuilt `ln` was also run on the NPU through the
harness: `y maxrel 5.4e-8`, `xn` bit-exact, same as the shipped one. The same
check passed again on 2026-09-05 after the designs were rewritten to take
every dimension from the recipe (all six streams byte-identical), and the
8-layer decode through the manifest interpreter scored the same
0.999998 / 0.999996 / 0.999991 logits correlation as before.

## Selecting it

The app uses the open engine for `qwen3.6-moe` whenever the kernels are
installed for the model (`xclbins/<model name>/open_kernels/`, or
`<model dir>/open_kernels/`, or `FLM_OPEN_KERNELS_DIR`); `FLM_QWEN36_ENGINE=closed`
forces the closed DLL, `=open` fails loudly if the kernels are missing. XRT
builds only (`FLM_USE_HRX=OFF`), like the open embedding NPU backend. The
same holds for the `qwen3` dense models (`FLM_QWEN3_ENGINE`), for `llama`
(`FLM_LLAMA_ENGINE`) and for Gemma 3 text models: the engine is the same code,
the manifest is a different recipe's.

## A second family: Qwen3 dense (2026-09-05)

The engine does not know which family it runs. `open_kernels/recipes/qwen3.py`
turns a Qwen3 dense `config.json` (GQA with q/k RMSNorm, full RoPE, no
attention gate, silu-gated FFN, a q4_1 lm_head) into a kernel set of three:
`dx` (the whole layer in one dispatch: `designs/dense/dx.py`, the same 8 main
cores + norm helper + attention helper as the MoE designs), `ln` at the
model's width, `lm_head_q4` (the q4 GEMV with an uneven band split). New
kernel points that came with it, all validated by the layer test: K = 2560 and
9728 GEMVs (activations that are not a whole number of 4 KB elements are
prepared by element index), HD 128 attention with 32/8 heads and full RoPE
(`ATTN_*` macros; the attention core's element is one KV-row half), the
2560-wide norm (`LN_N`), and the position record's sin placed right after its
cos (the fixed offset the 27B used only fit 32 values).

| speed | prefill 129 ms/token, decode 272 ms/token (3.7 tok/s): every token streams the model's 2.3 GB of q4 weights once, which is the floor of this dataflow on the NPU's DDR bandwidth |

`model/dense_probe.py` compares each stage's DDR bounce (xn, q/k/v, og, out,
res, xm, h, out2) of a dumped `act` buffer with the replica, fed the NPU's own
input, so a stage's error is localized rather than compounded.

## A third family: Llama 3 (2026-09-05)

Llama 3.1 8B runs on the same dense recipe (`recipes/dense.py`, family
`llama3`) with no new kernel: what differs is expressed as spec fields and
compile-time knobs -- no q/k norms (`ATTN_QKNORM=0`), eps 1e-5 (`LN_EPS`),
the llama3 RoPE frequency scaling computed host side
(`ModelSpec.rope_inv_freq`, carried in the manifest, used by both
position-table builders; it reproduces the container's own `rope_freqs.weight`
divisors to bf16 precision). Two sizes needed a different shape of the same
work: the 8 KB norm elements would not fit the norm helper's fused kernel
(five inputs and three outputs at once = its whole memory), so `ln_y` /
`ln_xn` emit one element per call; and the K = 14336 activation table (32 KB)
leaves room for only one 5 KB weight chunk per element (`per_call` in the
recipe, the GEMV entry generated with it).

| speed | prefill 125 ms/token, decode 203 ms/token (4.9 tok/s) for 4.5 GB of q4 weights per token |

## A fourth family: Gemma 3 (2026-09-05) -- the "new op" proof

Gemma 3 4B (text) runs on the dense recipe with the plan's new ops expressed
as knobs, patches and one small kernel: GeGLU-tanh is the generated
activation TU (`dense_act.cc`: x * sigmoid(2z)); the sandwich norms are
`ln_nr32` (a norm without residual, emitting f32 halves) plus the layer
design's sandwich program (t = post_attn_norm(out); res = x + t;
xm = pre_ffn_norm(res); t2 = post_ffn_norm(out2); xres = res + t2); the
sliding window is a per-token `attnpos` patch (the KV fill's offset and
length, the record's row counts) on a second kernel entry (`dx_local`) that
shares the global layers' instruction stream but owns its instruction BO and
window; each layer type has its own position table (local theta 1e4, global
1e6 linearly scaled by 8). The container stores the norms' `1 + w` and the
sqrt(hidden)-scaled embeddings, so those two plan items are not transforms
here (checked against the HF mirror by range requests).

Images still route through the closed engine — the open one refuses an image
payload with a clear error rather than silently ignoring it.

## Results (2026-09-05, Strix, Windows + XRT, stock Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)

Scored against the fp64 reference `open_kernels/model/replica.py` computes from
the same container (the oracle the kernels were accepted against):

Full model: weights resident in **84 s** (21 GB packed from the mmap'd
container), prefill **124 ms/token** (decode-as-prefill, lm_head skipped),
decode **~140 ms/token ≈ 7 tok/s** (part 0 ≈ 95 ms, MoE ≈ 26 ms, lm_head
12 ms, routing 0.2 ms). The closed engine on the same box, quiet, does ~6.8
tok/s (phlegm's measurement); yesterday's 323 ms/token was the batch harness
on a memory-starved box, not the kernels.

## What is still not closed

- **Batched prefill.** Prompt tokens go through the decode step one at a time.
  Exact, but 124 ms each: a 500-token prompt is a minute. The closed engine
  has batch kernels; nobody has written open ones (phlegm's plan called it
  "weeks, gated on one experiment").
- **Long-context attention cost.** The attention kernel is one core walking the
  cache: ~24 µs per cached row per attention layer, so a 4096-token context
  adds ~1 s per token across the 10 attention layers. Capacity is no longer
  capped (KV buffers are sized from the app's context length); speed at long
  context is a kernel item.
- **Vision.** The model is a VLM; images still need the closed engine.
- **The weight file** is still FLM's `.q4nx`. The GGUF path is a separate piece
  of work; this reader is ~150 lines and will go with it.
- **Memory.** The engine holds 21.6 GB of NPU buffers, and on Windows those
  are managed by the video memory manager and can be evicted under pressure —
  the first server run on a 47 GB box with 0.6 GB free hung a kernel (ERT
  state 8) and the context was dead from then on. Two mitigations are in:
  the container's mapped pages are dropped after packing (they were another
  ~13 GB of working set with no further use), and a failed kernel marks the
  engine so the next request rebuilds it (~90 s) instead of failing forever.
  Budget ~25 GB free for the full model.

## Through the app (2026-09-05)

`flm.exe` built on this box with the vcpkg route (`src/build-windows-vcpkg.cmd`,
notes in `WinSetup.md`). `flm serve qwen3.6-moe:35b-a3b` picks the open engine
(the log says so: *"Qwen3.6-MoE on the open kernels (...)"*) and answers
OpenAI-style chat completions:

| prompt | answer | TTFT | decode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Explain what an NPU is in two sentences. | *An NPU is a specialized hardware component designed to accelerate the processing of neural network workloads. It enables AI applications to run more efficiently by offloading complex computations from general-purpose CPUs.* | 2.2 s / 19 tok | 6.9 tok/s |
| Write a haiku about silicon. | *Silicon is gold, / Chips hum in the server room, / Data flows like light.* | 1.7 s / 15 tok | 7.0 tok/s |
| What is 2+2? Answer briefly. | *2+2=4* | 2.1 s / 18 tok | 5.8 tok/s |
| What is the capital of France? | *The capital of France is **Paris**.* | 1.7 s / 15 tok | 6.3 tok/s |

The same prompt twice in one server session gives the same answer (state reset
through the app's checkpoint/restore path). Prompt cache, sampler, chat
template, tool parsing — all the app's, unchanged.
