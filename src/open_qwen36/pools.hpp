/// \file pools.hpp
/// \brief Pack a layer's weights out of the `.q4nx` container into the byte
///        layouts the open kernels stream, following the manifest's packing
///        plan (open_kernels/recipes/qwen36moe.py `pack_plan`).
///
/// Nothing is dequantized or requantized: the 5120-byte q4_1 chunks are copied
/// verbatim, only their ORDER changes, because the AIE array streams a matrix
/// band by band rather than in the file's raster order. The laws are the ones
/// phlegm verified byte-for-byte against pools captured from FLM's own engine;
/// open_kernels/recipes/pack.py is the same interpreter in NumPy, and
/// specs/open-engine/tests/test_pack_plan.py holds it to the frozen originals.
///
/// Ops: std_perm (a standard [out, in] matmul tensor into 64-row band order),
/// expert_stripes (routed up/gate as interleaved transposed stripes),
/// expert_down (the routed down slices), put (small weights verbatim),
/// conv_transpose (conv1d [taps, NCH] -> [groups][taps][width]).
