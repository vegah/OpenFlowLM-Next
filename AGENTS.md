# Help a model out!

You can install or request toolchain components

Each time you build a new set of xclbins and libraries, document your process and create a new skill file for the next to build on.

Skills provide specialized instructions and workflows for specific tasks.
Use the skill tool to load a skill when a task matches its description.

The new format Q4NX models for this will be located on huggingface `Atomic-Germ/*-nB-OpenNPU2`, each will need a builder in q4nx-build as they gain xclbin support. Family xclbins will be distributed with the application, and a converted model ships with the rest. Each model links to a family xclbin, regardless of fine-tuning or derivitive models. The purpose of this is to allow quick additions of new but shape-identical models without updates needed, distributed through `flm-add` to install and link properly.

As you encounter closed-source requirements, note them and replace with "not implemented" messaging before coding a replacement.

When investigating pre-compiled xclbins and libraries, save any useful tools you may create to the `utilities/` directory rather than leaving them in a temp folder.

The `flm-test` tool at `utilities/flm-test` is capable of running a full test suite for `--llm`, `--vision`, `--embed`, or `--tools`.

The `q4nx-build` tool at `utilities/q4nx-build` should always be in-sync with the expected formats of the models as each gains support, there should be no manual steps left. If unavoidable, the user should always recieve instruction for it.

For each successfully packed model, create or update a skill to ensure the next agent does not need to reproduce research for the next addition.

Note: Peano (llvm-aie) has not been added to PATH to avoid conflict with
      system clang/clang++. It can be found in:
      ./ironvenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/llvm-aie/bin

Activate the ironvenv/bin/activate; use source utilities/mlir-aie/utils/env_setup.sh also *if needed*

## Building xclbins

The xclbins are built, not checked in. There is ONE command for every design set
in the repository, and one document describing the convention:

    python tools/build_designs.py doctor   # can this shell build at all?
    python tools/build_designs.py list     # what exists, and is it built?
    python tools/build_designs.py build    # build what is missing
    python tools/build_designs.py check    # do the built sets match their spec?

Read `docs/design-sets.md` before adding a third producer. The short version:
`ironvenv-requirements.txt` is the only toolchain pin, `tools/npu_designs.py`
holds everything two producers must agree about (the `toolchain.json` schema,
the shared `~/.npu/cache` lock, the device pin, the xclbin comparison), and each
producer's flags stay in its own spec — `npu_offload/gemm_rtp/families.json` and
`open_kernels/export_qwen36_kernels.py`'s `SETS`. Nothing restates them.
